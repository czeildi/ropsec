# Background

It is good practice to sign your commits so that your commits can be verified as certainly made by you and not by someone impersonating you.

<img src="../man/figures/signed_commit.png" align="center"/>

One technology to enable this is [GPG](https://gnupg.org/), which has an [R wrapper](https://github.com/jeroen/gpg) written by [Jeroen Ooms](https://github.com/jeroen). The current package provides helper functions and aims to ease the process as much as possible.

Having verified commits has two components:

- [sign your commits](#sign_commits) (with private key),
- [upload your public key](#upload_key) to GitHub, Gitlab, etc so that they can verify your commits (with public key).

If you are interested in the background, 
[general info on GPG](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gpg/vignettes/intro.html) is highly recommended.

During the process of creating a private key you will have the option to add password protection. It is strongly recommended to do so otherwise someone having access to your computer will immediately have access to your private key as well. ([Reference](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c481.html).)

# How to sign commits

1. Install system dependencies ([GPG Installation instructions](https://github.com/jeroen/gpg#installation))
    - macOS: `brew install gnupg` (check if already installed with `gpg --version`)
        - for password management from Rstudio
            - `brew install pinentry-mac`
            - `echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`
            - `gpgconf --kill gpg-agent` to make sure it will reload configuration
    - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): 
        - `apt install libgpgme-dev` (to be able to install `gpg` R package which is a dependency of `ropsec`)
2. install ropsec: `devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/ropsec")`
3. generate private - public keypair and set it to sign commits
    - [one email used with git](#single)
    - [multiple emails used with git](#multiple)
4. [upload public key to GitHub/Gitlab/etc](#upload_key)


# Sign commits {#sign_commits}

## Single email address, first-time usage {#single}

Run the following command once in any working directory to generate a new key and set it to sign all future commits in all repositories. The email address must be identical to the one you use with the corresponding repository management service (i.e. GitHub, etc).

```{r eval=FALSE}
new_key <- sign_commits_with_key(
  name = "John Doe", email = "johndoe@example.com"
)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
cat('John Doe` (as provided) and
`johndoe@example.com` (as provided)
will be used to generate a new gpg key.
Do you want to protect your new gpg key with a password? Password protection is strongly recommended unless you are only testing.

1: Yes
2: no
3: cancel

Selection: 1
Please enter password for new gpg key, to cancel press `Cancel` in Rstudio or `Ctrl + c` in terminal: ********
✔ Key with id `D21F047BDE943F74` successfully generated.
Do you want to sign future commits with `D21F047BDE943F74` in all repositories?

1: Absolutely not
2: Yes
3: Not now

Selection: 2
● The next step is uploading the public key to GitHub or alternative (unless it is already uploaded),  which you can do by passing the return value ("D21F047BDE943F74") to `store_public_key`.
[1] "D21F047BDE943F74"')
```

Next step: [upload your public key](#upload_key) to GitHub/Gitlab/etc.

## Multiple email addresses, first-time usage {#multiple}

One common use-case is to have a personal and a work email or two different work emails as well and you use git with both of them. At the first time you want to use them, generate a key and set to use it in the repository. The email addresses must be identical to the ones you use with the corresponding repository management service(s) (i.e. GitHub, etc).

Run the following in a personal (aka email address 1) git repository:

```{r eval=FALSE}
new_key <- sign_commits_with_key(
  name = "John Doe", email = "jd@personal.com", global = FALSE
)
```

Next step: [upload your public key](#upload_key) to GitHub/Gitlab/etc.

In a work-related git repository:

```{r eval=FALSE}
new_key <- sign_commits_with_key(
  name = "John Doe", email = "jd@company.com", global = FALSE
)
```

Next step: [upload your public key](#upload_key) to GitHub/Gitlab/etc.

## Multiple email addresses, existing key

Later, for convenience the appropriate key can be identified based on email as well or if the local git config is set you can even rely on that.

In another work-related repository:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(email = "jd@company.com", global = FALSE)
```

In yet another work-related repository:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config user.email jd@company.com
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(global = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat('✔ Existing key found: `D21F047BDE943F74`.
Corresponding email: `johndoe@example.com` (based on global git config).

✔ Everything is already set on your local machine for signing commits.
● The next step is uploading the public key to GitHub or alternative (unless it is already uploaded),  which you can do by passing the return value ("D21F047BDE943F74") to `store_public_key`.
[1] "D21F047BDE943F74"')
```

You may choose to set one of them globally which thus will be the default key to use in a repository where the repository level configs are not set to a different value.

## Single email address, existing key

(possibly generated with `gpg --full-generate-key` or with this package previously)

### provide key id

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(key = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP")
```

# Upload your public key to repository management services {#upload_key}

To generate a new key or find an existing one, use [`sign_commits_with_key`](#sign_commits). In the following `new_key` refers to the id of the key you want to upload that you can get as the return value of [`sign_commits_with_key`](#sign_commits).

To upload to GitHub without leaving your R session you need the following:

- a personal access token with at least `write:gpg_key` scope enabled. You can grant access to tokens [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
- supply your token manually or store it in `GITHUB_PAT` env var
- `store_public_key(key = new_key, service = "gh")` or `store_public_key(key = new_key, service = "gh", .token = token)`

To upload to Gitlab without leaving your R session you need the following:

- a personal access token with at least `api` scope enabled.
- `store_public_key(key = new_key, service = "gl", gitlab_url = "https://gitlab.example.com")`

You can use any service (GitHub, Gitlab etc) which supports GPG by manually adding your **public** GPG key which you can get by

- `store_public_key(key = new_key)` or
- `cat(gpg::gpg_export(key = new_key))`

# Troubleshooting

## Turn it off

If you do not want to sign commits or there is some issue and you cannot even commit, the easiest solution is setting  `commit.gpgsign` in the git config to `false`. You can do it by running one of the following commands in your terminal:

- in specific repository: `git config commit.gpgsign false`
- globally: `git config --global commit.gpgsign false`

## Check

- `git verify-commit HEAD` or `git log --show-signature`
- signing plaintext: `echo "test" | gpg --clearsign`
- commit from command line and not Rstudio or another GUI

## Attempt to fix

- check that `git config gpg.program` matches your installed version
- set env var: `GPG_TTY=$(tty)` (with `echo "export GPG_TTY=$(tty)" >> ~/.bashrc ` or similar), then `gpgconf --kill gpg-agent` to make sure it will reload configuration
- `echo 'no-tty' >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`, then `gpgconf --kill gpg-agent` to make sure it will reload configuration

# Further details

If you use other gpg program, for example gnupg2 on Linux, you have to run the following first:

```bash
git config --global gpg.program gpg2
```

In addition to generating a GPG keys, the following git config elements are manipulated:

- `gpg.program`
- `commit.gpgsign`
- `user.email`
- `user.name` (read-only)
- `user.signingkey`

## Password remembering

- keychain: if you opt for this option, keychain can remember your password forever.
- gpg agent: remembers password until the process is alive or password cache ttl expires. (Relevant options: -max-cache-ttl (2 hours by default) and --default-cache-ttl (10 minutes by default). [Reference](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Agent-Options.html).)
