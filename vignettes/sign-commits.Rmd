# Background

It is good practice to sign your commits so that your commits can be verified as certainly made by you and not by someone impersonating you.

<img src="../man/figures/signed_commit.png" align="center"/>

One technology to enable this is [GPG](https://gnupg.org/), which has an [R wrapper](https://github.com/jeroen/gpg) written by [Jeroen Ooms](https://github.com/jeroen). The current package provides helper functions and aims to ease the process as much as possible.

Having verified commits has two components:

- [sign your commits](#sign_commits) (with private key),
- [upload your public key](#upload_key) to GitHub, Gitlab, etc so that they can verify your commits (with public key).

If you are interested in the background, 
[general info on GPG](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gpg/vignettes/intro.html) is highly recommended.

# How to sign commits

1. Install system dependencies ([GPG Installation instructions](https://github.com/jeroen/gpg#installation))
    - OSX: `brew install gnupg` (check if installed with `gpg --version`)
    - Linux: `apt-get install gnupg` (check if installed with `gpg --version`)
2. install ropsec: `devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/ropsec")`
3. generate key and set it to sign commits
    - [one email used with git](#single)
    - [multiple emails used with git](#multiple)
4. [upload key to GitHub/Gitlab/etc](#upload_key)


# Sign commits {#sign_commits}

## Single email address, first-time usage {#single}

Run the following command once in any working directory to generate a new key and set it to sign all future commits in all repositories.

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(name = "John Doe", email = "johndoe@example.com")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
message("`John Doe` (as provided) and
`johndoe@example.com` (as provided)
will be used to generate a new gpg key.")
cat("Please enter password for new gpg key: ********\n")
cat("Do you want to sign all future commits with `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP` in all repositories?

1: Yes
2: Not now
3: Absolutely not
Selection: 1")
"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP"
```

Next step: [upload your public key](#upload_key) to GitHub/Gitlab/etc.

## Multiple email addresses, first-time usage {#multiple}

One common use-case is to have a personal and a work email as well and you use git with both of them. At the first time you want to use them, generate a key and set to use it in the repository.

Run the following in a personal git repository:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(name = "John Doe", email = "jd@personal.com", global = FALSE)
```

Next step: [upload your public key](#upload_key) to GitHub/Gitlab/etc.

In a work-related git repository:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(name = "John Doe", email = "jd@company.com", global = FALSE)
```

Next step: [upload your public key](#upload_key) to GitHub/Gitlab/etc.

## Multiple email addresses, existing key

Later, for convenience the appropriate key can be identified based on email as well or if the local git config is set you can even rely on that.

In another work-related repository:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(email = "jd@company.com", global = FALSE)
```

In yet another work-related repository:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config user.email jd@company.com
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(global = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("Existing key found: 1234561234561234.
Corresponding email: jd@company.com (based on local git config).

Do you want to sign all future commits with `1234561234561234` in this repository?

1: Yes
2: Absolutely not
3: Not now

Selection: 1")
"1234561234561234"
```

You may choose to set one of them globally which thus will be the default key to use in a repository where the repository level configs are not set to a different value.

## Single email address, existing key

(possibly generated with `gpg --full-generate-key` or with this package previously)

### provide key id

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(key = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP")
```

### find based on user name and/or email

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(name = "John Doe")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
message("Existing key found: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP.
Corresponding email: johndoe@example.com (based on local git config).

Do you want to sign all future commits with `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP` in all repositories?
...")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
sign_commits_with_key(email = "johndoe@example.com")
```

# Upload your public key to repository management services {#upload_key}

To upload to GitHub without leaving your R session you need the following:

- a personal access token with at least `write:gpg_key` scope enabled. You can grant access to tokens [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
- `gh_store_key(key, token)`

You can use any service (GitHub, Gitlab etc) which supports GPG by manually adding your **public** GPG key which you can get by

- `gh_store_key(new_key)` or
- `cat(gpg::gpg_export(new_key))`

# Further details

If you use other gpg program, for example gnupg2 on Linux, you have to run the following first:

```bash
git config --global gpg.program gpg2
```

In addition to generating a GPG keys, the following git config elements are manipulated:

- `gpg.program`
- `commit.gpgsign`
- `user.email`
- `user.name` (read-only)
- `user.signingkey`

## usage alongside packrat

If you want to sign commits in a git repository where you use [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) but you do not want to add ropsec as a dependency to your project, you can use the below, if `ropsec` is installed  on your machine:

- `packrat::with_extlib(c("ropsec", "git2r", "getPass", "rstudioapi"), ropsec::sign_commits_with_key(..., global = FALSE))`
- `packrat::with_extlib(c("ropsec", "git2r"), ropsec::gh_store_key(...))`
